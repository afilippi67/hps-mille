             Explanation of iteration table
             ==============================
       it =  iteration number. Global parameters are improved for it > 0.
             First function evaluation is called iteraton 0.
       fc =  number of function evaluations.
fcn_value =  value of 2 x Likelihood function (LF).
             The final value is the chi^2 value of the fit and should
             be about equal to the NDF (see below).
 dfcn_exp =  expected reduction of the value of the Likelihood function (LF)
     slpr =  ratio of the actual slope to inital slope.
    costh =  cosine of angle between search direction and -gradient
      iit =  number of internal iterations in GMRES/MINRES algorithmus
       st =  stop code of GMRES/MINRES algorithmus
             < 0:   rhs is very special, with beta2 = 0
             = 0:   rhs b = 0, i.e. the exact solution is  x = 0
             = 1    requested accuracy achieved, as determined by rtol
             = 2    reasonable accuracy achieved, given eps
             = 3    x has converged to an eigenvector
             = 4    matrix ill-conditioned (Acond has exceeded 0.1/eps)
             = 5    the iteration limit was reached
             = 6    Matrix x vector does not define a symmetric matrix
             = 7    Preconditioner does not define a symmetric matrix
       ls =  line search info
             < 0    recalculate function
             = 0:   N or STP lt 0 or step not descending
             = 1:   Linesearch convergence conditions reached
             = 2:   interval of uncertainty at lower limit
             = 3:   max nr of line search calls reached
             = 4:   step at the lower bound
             = 5:   step at the upper bound
             = 6:   rounding error limitation
     step =  the factor for the Newton step during the line search. Usually
             a value of 1 gives a sufficient reduction of the LF. Oherwise
             other step values are tried.
     cutf =  cut factor. Local fits are rejected, if their chi^2 value
             is larger than the 3-sigma chi^2 value times the cut factor.
             A cut factor of 1 is used finally, but initially a larger
             factor may be used. A value of 0.0 means no cut.
  rejects =  total number of rejected local fits.
   hmmsec =  the time in hours (h), minutes (mm) and seconds.
      FMS =  calculation of Function value, Matrix, Solution.
